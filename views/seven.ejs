              <blockquote>
                "Since 1985, Guitar Craft courses have been held in fourteen
                countries; and attended by some 3,000 students of many
                nationalities, ages and a diversity of cultural backgrounds. The
                Guitar Craft Tuning generated a need for a new guitar
                repertoire, the pieces all appeared in the first few months of
                activity. Properly, they are only one part of a larger body of
                practice that is introduced in person. Nevertheless, they are
                presented here in the hope that they resonate within the wider
                community."<q>â€”Robert Fripp</q>
