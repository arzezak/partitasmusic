                Traditionally, we write and share our compositions with guitar
                in hand, often in residential courses. The recordings and scores
                on this website partially represent the Music and facilitate its
                transmission. Perhaps in a similar way a photograph relates to
                the real, living presence of the photographed.

                This first sample of repertoire represents a small part of the
                original music composed on the GC Tuning (CGDAEG) from 1985 to
                the present day. The aim of this section is to open up the
                possibility for this music to be played by different ensembles
                or soloists, and thus strengthen our common practice.

                The invitation to expand this space remains open. We look
